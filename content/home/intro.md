## What you can expect

We specialize in high-quality fly-fishing trips and mule deer hunts. Our fly-fishing trips take place on the famed Missouri River. We provide half too many day float trips for all skill levels. Fly-fish with the Missouri River experts! We specialize in Big Brown Trout!

All our hunts take place on well-managed private ranches. Our playground is in the beautiful setting of Southeast Montana's big sky country. The hunts we provide are much more than harvesting a trophy animal. The emphasis is all about aspects of the huntâ€”adventure, scenery, wildlife, and friendship.

Channel Outfitters lease some of the finest deer habitat in North America. Managed ranches are available for older age classes. Montana is one of the few states that have a rifle season through the entire rut process. The rut is the best opportunity to pursue mature bucks. Hunting big bucks can take a toll, and when you return, you will enjoy the comforts of Miles City. One of the more famous western cow towns, Miles City, is a unique quality of your trip.

We help you in every aspect of planning your trip, including lodging and travel to license applications. Whether a first-time mule deer hunter or a seasoned veteran, you can trust Channel Outfitters with your Montana Mule Deer hunt.
