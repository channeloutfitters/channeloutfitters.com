We offer trophy antelope hunts with rifles or bows. The antelope hunt is one of the most exciting action-packed hunts, with a rifle and 100% shooting opportunity. This is a great father/son hunt. It is common to see over one hundred antelope a day on most of our ranches making the hunts full of action. Montana antelope bow hunts run through the rut in September. The use of a decoy can create close encounters and fast action. We use blinds at water holes and decoys to get the antelope within bow range. Montana antelope tags are near 100% draw odds for bow hunters. Our antelope hunts are the most affordable guided hunts.
