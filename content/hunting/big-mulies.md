Our guided Montana deer hunts are of the finest guided mule deer hunts available. We lease hundreds of square miles of prime mule deer habitat to provide our clients with first-class hunting. Eastern Montana is home to some of the best mule deer habitats in North America. We are fortunate to have exclusive leases on some excellent properties making us the clear choice for Miles City Outfitters. Channel Outfitters manages each ranch to produce trophy-quality mule deer. Our ranches are strictly controlled for quality mature animals. Only Channel Outfitters clients can hunt these ranches, ensuring every hunt is an extraordinary experience.
