![Your Hunt Remembered](images/your-hunt-remembered.png)

We offer high-quality big game hunts. Experience trophy Mule Deer, Pronghorn Antelope, and Montana Whitetail Deer in the Big Sky Country. We have some of the best hunting leases on large private ranches. They provide fair chase hunts of the highest standards for rifle and bow hunters through stringent management goals. Montanaâ€™s rifle season runs through the entire deer rut, and many of our bigger trophies are harvested during this time. The hunting tags almost always are 100% draws, and we will assist our clients on all licensing matters. Channel Outfitters also offers antelope and deer combo hunts. The antelope tags are near 100%, drawing odds for bow hunts and 40% for rifles.
