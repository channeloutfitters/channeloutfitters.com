It's that time of year when serious mule deer hunters are making some plans. Laying awake thinking of Where to go. When to go, what tags can I draw? If you don't have the points to draw your dream tag, do you throw down on a guided hunt? Yes! That is exactly what you do! Throw caution to the wind and sign up.

If you are going to book a hunt, you need tags!  You will want to book with an outfitter in some state that has deer tags available. A bonus would be if said outfitter had hunts during the rut, when big deer are on their feet.  It would also be nice if the outfitter had some good private land to hunt.  Private land that has some great habitat and some beautiful scenery.  Some place that has all of those things plus really experienced guides who want nothing more than catching a big old buck for their dudes.

You actually can do all of that with us and the price isn't to bad either.  Now that you have the vision, go ask your wife if you can miss Thanksgiving. Maybe she will let you go before Thanksgiving! You won't know until you ask.
