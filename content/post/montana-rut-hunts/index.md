Well, here goes hunt story number two. My wife says that everyone loves these hunt stories. I don't really like to write the stories because it is hard to write sarcasm! This hunt took place about mid November. The deer were rutting hard but the Super Moon had showed up. The big moon plays a role in deer movement during the rut. The hunting had been stellar but I feared a big slow down due to the moon.

First day of the hunt for some great guys from San Antonio. Art was up to shoot first. We were looking for a big deer I had seen the hunt before. I thought he would go 180 or better. As we set up in our early morning perch, we glassed across a valley with hay fields on the bottom. We spotted a few young bucks and many does. Finally I seen a good one and put my spotting scope on him. He was a great young deer with potential for next year, we passed!

After glassing for quite some time it was time to move. As we got up I looked to our right and seen a good buck rutting does. He was under our nose the whole time. We needed to get a better look! The deer was only a half mile away but was now out of our sight. On the way we bumped a few doe with some small bucks in tow. As we approached the spot where we had last seen the big one. There he was laying in the wide open prairie with three does.

We had to get flat on the ground as not to be seen. We were able to look at the buck for a long time as he lay there chewing his cud. He looked like he was old and we could see he had some extras. I could not put eye guards on him but Kyle said he could. I propped up my pack and had Art get in position to shoot. We laid on the cold ground for quite a while waiting for our chance. I was starting to shiver but Art stayed calm.

The deer finally stood up, we all agreed that this would be a good first Mule Deer for Art! Just as Art was going to shoot the buck laid back down. The buck got up again and never gave a good angle, the tension was building! Finally he turned and Art put it on the money at 240 yards. I told him to shoot again but it was not needed.

As we approached Art's first muley it looked good! I was surprised to see the buck had double eye guards on both sides! A big hook and nice mass, a real character buck! Nice shooting Art!
