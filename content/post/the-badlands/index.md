The second installment of the 2015 hunt stories starts now. The hunter is Eric, aka "Easy E. We have been hunting together for several straight years. Eric comes with a great attitude and is always ready to shoot! We are always looking for an older deer, something to be proud of! This year it happened on day 2.

As we were on our way to check a spot, I noticed something out on the sky-line that looked out-of-place. I threw up the old binos and sure enough BIG BUCK! I'm telling Easy to SHOOT! Eric however is a shooter not a spotter. Now begins the long process  of explaining were on the horizon is the deer. After what seems like forever, I have narrowed it down to between the only 2 cedar trees out there.

The deer was just staring our way, not sure if we are a doe he should check out. Finally Eric is down on his gun and just about ready to shoot as the deer starts to cruz. We did a quick run to the edge of a large canyon. I see him again stopped and staring our way. Shoot, he is standing by that tree! Eric is on him and I hear his safety click. Plug the ears before the 300 ultra mag blows my ears out.

The shot was a 299 yard chip shot for Easy. The deer leaped out of sight at the report of the shot. We made our way to where we last seen the deer. Ready for a follow-up shot but none needed. A beautiful buck lay at our feet! A 4x4 with good mass and a double eye guard on one side. No ground shrinkage here! Eric's smile says it all.
