Wï»¿e have been experiencing a bit of a whitetail deer increase over the last couple of seasons. While the mule deer are going through a bit of hard times from drought, the whitetails are doing good and getting big. We had some good ones live through the season because our hunters are always so focused on mule deer. The deer pictured got the pass because our hunters kill big whiteys in Ohio. The moisture outlook is looking up with plenty of snow and rain. Maybe next season will be drought free, and we can get the Mule Deer back to more stable conditions. Booking now for archery Elk and Whitetail rifle.
