Well gang, the hopper fishing has been better than I've seen in many years. Forty eats a day will keep things interesting. I'm not sure what causes a great hopper fishing season on the Mighty Mo other than a strong hopper crop. Even on years with a good grasshopper hatch sometimes the trout are not excited about eating them, not the case this year. I have some clients that ready to return at the same time next year for some more action. The downside to hopper fishing is that it takes place during the dog days of summer. This means, early starts and early off the water. One thing about hopper fishing that is undebatable, the way fish eat the fly is the coolest. The fish come slow and cautious. You must wait a bit before you strike. This guy got it right!
