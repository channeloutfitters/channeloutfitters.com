The old saying, "You should have been here yesterday" really applies to the late April fly-fishing. We were lucky with the weather and the big brown trout really came out to play. Going into May, the water temps are starting to warm a bit and we are getting some hatches. BWOs are on daily, and the March Browns and Mother's Day Caddis are beginning. Usually, lower water flows mean good spring dry-fly fishing. The streamer bite is good for those who put the time in. The nymph fishing is stupid! May is a really good month to fish the Mighty Mo.
