I've been trying to learn how to oil paint. For some reason I always paint America Indians, specifically Nez Perce. I like to portray the people who lived in the mid to early 1700s. I find the people who lived during this time are most interesting. You can say this is my happy place. Well before the push to tame the west, when people and landscapes were still free. Life was hard back then, but it must of been something to behold. Before guns, when your very life depended on hunting skills. The women of the time also had mad survival skills!

The painting is titled "Nimi'ipuu", the translation is "We The People". Ironic isn't it? Progress and wild things can't get along! It must have been something to see, before the colonization began. Maybe it looked like this? You can learn everything about the proud Nez Perce in the Alvin Josephy Jr. book titled "The Nez Perce Indians And The Opening Of The Northwest".
