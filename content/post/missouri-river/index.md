Well folks the Mighty Mo is fishing really well! May is nearly gone and June is my favorite month! June brings the best dry-fly fishing of the season. The big fish like to eat the PMDs and caddis at the same time, what ever fly get to the fish first. The river still needs to come down a bit for great dry-fly action. Look for mid month to be great fishing like the Missouri is famous for!
