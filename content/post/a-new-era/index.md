Hunting has changed a lot over the last few years. Nowadays if you want to have a quality hunt you must plan ahead. Just to draw a tag in the western states requires some planning. The first thing you need is a tag, the second thing you need is time. Money could be the answer to both the tag and the time restraints. Most of us hunters have to plan well in advance and save for that special hunt.

I have been building some points in a few western states. I've been dreaming and scheming on what, when, and where to apply for. Usually for me it's always next year, next year I'll have the time, next year I'll draw the tag. I'm not sure where I'm going with post, I guess I've been dreaming about a great out-of-state hunt. After all, many application deadlines are already upon us.

In Montana we have many available deer and elk tags! A few years back some of Montana's dumbest finest decided to get rid of our Outfitter Sponsored Tags. The intent was to crush the outfitting industry and curb leasing. What happened was the opposite. The new law flooded the market with tags to make up for the deficit it created. I'm not complaining, business is booming! Leasing is out of control! To many deer and elk are getting killed on public land! Unintended consequences of a poorly written law. Liberals aren't the only ones who think with their hearts.

Back to the topic! where are you going to hunt in 2015? Have you made plans? Maybe you'll draw the big tag this year? I did in 2013. It might be your turn this year!
