My favorite time to fish is in the spring. Spring brings new hope for all of the hatches to come. Spring brings hope for all those big fish you never caught last year! I prefer the first half of the season more than the second half.

The first major Hatch begins in April. The BWO hatch is quiet major and can happen for 3 weeks or so. This is not the hatch that you can depend on day in and day out. These small may flies are effected by weather. Just when you think it is raining to hard for a good dry-fly bite, boom a bunch of big fish up and eating! Sometimes you think it is to sunny. Wrong, big browns up and vulnerable! Some days the conditions seem perfect for the big hatch and it doesn't happen. The streamer road is always ready!

When the hatches are lacking, I always like to throw streamers. On occasion some big fish fall to streamers in the spring! The nymph fishing can be really hard to beat this time of year as well. Come on over to the Missouri river in April. You will be glad you did!
