You might know by now, I like to fish! I like to throw myself or guiding people suits me just fine. I like to pursue "Big Gators! You know, the kind of fish you would expect in the " Butterscotch Chronicles!

I've been trout bum in around since 1989, I got the habit bad! One thing that still really turns my crank is putting a over-weight slobs into my net. You know the kind of fish I'm talking about, Long and Fat! That's the kind I angle for!

The happy angler pictured above is my father "RD Channel. He bought me my first fly rod. Dad is retired, now we go catch pigs together! Stay tuned my friends, May is a good month for Butterscotch.
