Time to start fishing. Spring has sprung here in Montana. The streamer bite is on, and some dry fly stuff is around the corner. We always offer a spring discount for April. It's a fun time to get out, we always catch a few big brown trout. The weather can be all over the place, bring lots of gear. Full day trips are $450 in April. See you soon.
