Some people say they dislike fishing in August! The water is warm, the hatches are gone, lots of weeds. I have always loved August, the crowds are gone, the fish are big. You might as well say it's the time to catch big browns on hoppers, I just said it! The dog days are when the big ones fall to the foam. My new client Scott pictured above is a believer in the month of August. Scott says, why fish in the crowds when you can catch these with no one around? That's what I've been saying!

Hopper fishing good on certain days.

Nymph fishing is stellar everyday.

Trico's not so great.
