Here we are fishing into the month of May. Fly fishing on the Missouri River has started slow this spring due to high and cold water. We are starting to experience better more consistent fly fishing. The water temps are bringing the bigger and better hatches. We have been putting our clients on some rally good brown trout. The trend will continue as the water warms a few more degrees. Give us a call and get your days booked for the Mighty Mo.
