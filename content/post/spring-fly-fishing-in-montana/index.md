Time to get the dust off the rods and get ready. I always say the early bird gets the worm, not really but when it comes to fishing on Montana's Missouri River then, yes. Some big Brown Trout like to eat the streamer early in the spring. Many of my personal best fish were caught then. Before the crowds and before the aquatic vegetation grows. What's not to like? We also have the spring special $450 for a full day for two all April. What are you waiting for?
