Well here we are right in the middle of summer! The busy part of the fishing season is winding down. August will be like a ghost town on the Missouri River. We have had some great dry fly fishing in July, the fish continue to eat trico's and PMD's. The nymph fishing is always pretty good, no so much in the afternoons. The kid in the picture is Conner Quinn. He is a good kid and is becoming a real good fly fisher! See you, next year Conner!
