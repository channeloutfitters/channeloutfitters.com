Well folks, we are halfway through the season. I like the first half more than the second half. The fishing has been stellar up to this point! I have landed more big brown trout than ever before and that is saying a lot. We are seeing some strong caddis hatches and some good dry fly fishing. Looking forward to the rest of the summer, we will start early and end before the heat takes over. July is a busy month on the Mighty Mo but August is a lot quieter as far as fishing traffic. The hopper fishing is on its way so make plans now!
