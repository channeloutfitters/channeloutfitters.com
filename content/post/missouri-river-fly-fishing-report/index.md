The fishing is still pretty good. Nymph fishing is strong. Hopper fishing is good for those who can wait it out. Small dry's are really not that good, you can find a few fish eating in the morning, after that it's deadsville! The forecast is favorable in few days, cooler daytime temps and cold nights. The fish will dig it and so will you!
