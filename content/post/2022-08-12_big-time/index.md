The hot days of summer have been still producing some good fishing on the Mighty Mo. The dry-fly fishing has been really good despite the warm water and high air temperatures. The hopper fishing has been stellar! Pictured with a lifetime trout is our longtime friend and client Steve P. This giant brownie sipped a hopper pattern and Steve did the rest perfectly. Dreams are made of these.
