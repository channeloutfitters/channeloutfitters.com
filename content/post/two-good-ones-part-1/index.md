This is the tale of a really good hunt I guided last season. The hunters are some clients who had hunted with me several times in the past, they had not yet hunted this new wonderland I found up north. Mark and Melody are really a guides dream, they are fit, they hunt for the experience. If you ever thought about going on a long walk to explore a new area, these two will go. This is the story about a amazing few days.

Before the hunters arrived, we had been hit with a big snow storm. The storm had lots of wind causing drifting snow. Travel was difficult at best. The only places you could drive was where the ranchers were feeding livestock. Foot travel was also a challenge, walking through 3 foot drifts will test you! The first day of the hunt found us on a big walk about in a place that we call the stadium. This place is where all the big bucks go to find the ladies. The day was sunny and calm. You could glass up deer from miles away, it was awesome!

We seen several nice bucks that day, did a few stalks, and passed on some nice bucks. We probably seen 25 bucks and 4 near shooters. Just one of those days you don't forget. We walked most of the day, lots of deep snow but lots of bucks to keep you going. Melody is tough. Most of my male clients can not even come close to keeping up with her. At the end of day one, my clients are impressed with my leases, I am too.

Day two found us on another ranch. We found deer all day. The calm after a storm can make for some good hunting. We passed a bunch of next year deer and after some long walks we decided to head back towards the house. Heading through the cottonwoods on the creek bottom, we jumped 4 whitetail bucks. The deer ran a ways and stopped in the trees. I told Melody, the last one was a big old buck! She said I like that one. One quick shot and the deer all ran out of sight. The buck kicked like he was hit, but it was hard to follow him through the trees. We approached the area with caution.

We are starting to run out of daylight. Finally we found a drop of blood, then a few more. Finally lots of blood! Mark says there he is! The buck was down and did not go far. Melody made a good shot. What a big buck! This is what happens when you let them get to six and a half years old.
