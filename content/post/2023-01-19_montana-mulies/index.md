Jï»¿ackson came out to hunt with his father and brother. The boys had a good trip! This was Jacksons first deer hunt. The hunt lasted all of 2 hours. The guide and Jackson couldn't pass this beautiful 27-inch mule deer. The deer was dropped with one shot from the trusty Weatherby chambered in a 243.
