Had some fun times with the Tim Stein group. These guys do it right! Rent a house in Craig Montana and fish the Missouri for 3 days. Great food and great guides. They are booked for the same time next year because it is that good! Yes they do have a little competition, The biggest brown takes the cup. Ray won the prestigious award two years running. Not easy to do when the guides are trying to crush each other and the clients are out for blood! Good times with good guys!
