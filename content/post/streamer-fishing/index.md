Spring is the time to throw streamers. It's also a good time to catch those big weary brown trout. If you put in some time in the spring, the rewards are big! The first trip out this year was normal, cool and windy. The bite slow but rewards big! Spring streamer fishing is certainly not for everyone. You must really slow down your presentation, boat speed and position is critical. Most big fish that come to my net are because of small details, boat control is everything. Success also takes a patient angler in the cold spring water. For the others we have a thing called a bobber. The ones with patients and a desire to catch big ones, streamer fishing in the spring is a great game.
