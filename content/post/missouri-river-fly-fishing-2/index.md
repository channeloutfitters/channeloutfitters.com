Lots of water, Lots of big browns! The river has been plenty high this year, high water makes for some big fish. That being said, I'm over the high water and the nymph fishing! We can look forward to a good hopper fishing season but I'm afraid the may-fly and caddis hatch will be wasted due to high flows. If you waited to long to make plans this season, that might be a good thing. Lets hope the water drops and the fish rise. Until then we will just keep catching these!
