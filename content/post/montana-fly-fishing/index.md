Well folk, the fishing has been outstanding up to this point. I have landed more brown trout over 22 inches than ever before. Multiple two footers have been captured. Obviously, we have some upper age class fish in the river. The fishing has been good with all methods. Nymph fishing has been producing big numbers and big size. Dry fly fishing has been coming on a bit depending on weather. Streamers have been slow but rewarding. May has been great, I highly recommend fishing the Missouri in the spring. I will leave you with this picture of a spectacular dry fly fish we encountered the other day.
