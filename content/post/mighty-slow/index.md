Instead of the mighty mo it might be called the mighty slow. Many rivers hit a wall in August, the Missouri is no exception. One thing that always holds true is that a few big ones will eat a hopper! The beautiful lady holding the fish above knows that patience is key in the hopper game. Good for you Peggy!
