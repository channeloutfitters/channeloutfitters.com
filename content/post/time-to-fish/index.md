We are moving into spring! We all start to feel the need to fish this time of year! The water temp is getting close to 40 degrees on the Mighty Mo. I usually don't start fishing until the water hits 40. That is when fish start to chase things. At about 42 degrees you can get those blue wing olive hatches, that's when big dumb ones eat the dry fly! Hope to see you soon.
