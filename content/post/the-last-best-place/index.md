The fishing season is winding down. Some great fishing happens this time of year but all good things must end. I'm still fishing but also taking a few bow hunters. The fall is busy for this guy. As you look into plans for next year, one must decide if it's fly-fishing or hunting. A tough choice! I like a mixture of both, either way you can't go wrong. Montana is spectacular in the fall!
