It's all about the Mule Deer. The king of deer! This is a quick account of a great deer taken by one of our hunters last year. The hunter was a good guy named Scot. He had killed a giant of a Montana muley a few years back. Scot has the right mentality to get a big deer, he excepts all or nothing.

Scot came out to Montana with a truck full of guns and all the high-tech gear. His young son would tag along to witness the hunt. This would be the last hunt of the season, all my hunters had filled their tags before Scot. Sometimes the big ones don't show up until late in the season!

I had seen this buck once three weeks earlier. I should have got him then but he slipped away. I told all my hunters that about the mythical deer, but was unable to turn him up. I hunted around the area of the original siting but could not locate the beast. After three weeks, I was starting to wonder if he was really big or if I was just chasing a ghost.

Scot's hunt started out good. We spotted a really cool tall horned 5x5 but he gave us the slip. On day two we headed to the area where I had seen biggie. I was loosing hope of seeing the big again. I was having thoughts of how big he might be next season! As we were hunting down a little trail, we spotted a lone deer traveling with his head down, searching for doe tracks. We both put our binos on the deer at the same time. It took us only a couple of seconds to agree this was a shooter.

Scot's hunting skills took over as the deer now knew of or presence. The deer started to bolt as Scot drew down. Scot hit the big boy Three times as the beast tried to leave! The monarch died in grand fashion. It happened quick, Scot was ready to throw down. As we approached the deer, I could tell he was the big one I had seen earlier in the season. He died only 1200 yards from the original sighting.
