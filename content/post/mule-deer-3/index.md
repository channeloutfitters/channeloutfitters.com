It seems like everyone wants to hunt the mule deer. Places to hunt these awesome animals are getting harder to find. There has been a real increase in hunting interest over the last few years. After the Chinese flu was released on the public, people have started to get back to their roots. I have seen quite an up-tick in hunter inquiries. Certainly, a good problem for an outfitter. With the increase in hunters looking for hunting spots the wildlife is taking a real pounding! Let's face the facts, too much demand is hard on wildlife. The wildlife managers in Montana are completely insane! The game commission is living way in the past! A 5 weeklong rifle season in the prairie is out of line. Furthermore, the number of tags is never in check with the growing Montana population. I believe the good old days of public land hunting is over. Unless you draw a tag that take 15 to 30 years in some well managed unit trophy animals are only a dream. I've known for a long time, if you want anything nice you must have some skin in the game. Private land is the only place for big game to thrive. Even on private land it's hard to grow old deer, somehow, we still manage a few good ones every season.
