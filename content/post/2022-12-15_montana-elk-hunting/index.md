We have completed our first year offering elk hunting trips. The results were not too bad. We are doing trips in the famed Bull Mountains of Montana. The elk in the area are big and plentiful. The archery tag is guaranteed, and the rifle has around 25% odds. We will be taking deposits for a small number of lucky hunters who will be staying at our lodge in the little town of Musselshell Montana. Meals, lodging and guide service are all inclusive. Get ready for your next adventure.
