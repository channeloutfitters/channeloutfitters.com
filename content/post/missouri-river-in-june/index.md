Well, the best month of the year is here. By best, I mean Montana Fly-Fishing. This is the month when dry-fly fishing on the Missouri River is at it's best! We have seen a few fish starting to rise. As the water temps climb a bit we will see the big may PMD hatch, summer caddis are on the menu as well. The very best dry-fly fishing is close. Until then the nymph fishing has been insane! Streamer fishing is the big hit or miss, mostly miss as of late. If you want to join us next June you should consider making plans now. Most of our clients take the same dates every year. Stay tuned!
