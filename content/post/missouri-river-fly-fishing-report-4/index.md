We have high water here on the Mo. The fishing is very good! On years when the water gets really high the fish get really big! Of course the dry-fly fishing is not happening until the water gets below 12000 CFS. If you like to nymph fish with long leaders and lots of weight now is your time! We hook big ones every day when the water is high!
