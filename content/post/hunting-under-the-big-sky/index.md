I love to visit the small towns of Eastern Montana. When I'm out that way to do some hunting, I like to take in the local sights and sounds. The small cafes and the local bar that serves a Thanksgiving dinner, I dig it! I also take the time to check out the county museums. I would strongly recommend the Garfield County Museum, It's full of great Montana history including many dinosaur fossils. Its good to know about the places and people who shaped our great state of Montana.
