This is a very brief hunting story due to the nature of the hunt. The guy with the gorgeous mulie is Kevin. Kevin contacted us late in the summer and was able to connect with some of the leftover tags. The only spot I had open for Kevin was to be paired with another hunter on a 2 on 1 scenario. I generally do not like to get involved with pairing strangers, but Kevin was game!

Kevin's schedule would put him a day after the hunt started, his partner would have a 2 day jump. The first morning of Kevin's hunt, they spotted this beauty of a 4x4 rutting his does. Kev's hunting partner passed the deer leaving Kevin open to the stalk.

They waited for the deer to walk over a hill in order to make the move. The big buck was not in a hurry. The boys had a lot of time to look at the deer, he was a shooter for sure! Once the deer moved out of sight, the hunters made their move. Kevin made a good first and only shot. The buck was down for good.

Kevin took off that afternoon, he made it home in time to catch his kids football game. That's how you do it! Kevin spent only one night in Montana and hunted hard for about 1 hour.
