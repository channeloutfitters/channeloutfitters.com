We have been doing well catching Big Trout. High water always makes the fish big! I have been getting lucky landing some bigs every day. The water is back on the rise due to heavy rain storms up river. The fish are just getting bigger eating all the worms, ants, sowbugs and emerging insects. We are hopeful that the river will drop to offer a better dry- fly bite. Until then, we will be catching these to pass the time,
