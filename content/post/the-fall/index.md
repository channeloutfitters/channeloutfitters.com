Well kids, it looks like the August cool down has happened right on time. The dry-fly fishing this August has been the best I've ever seen! I think the fish will continue to look up for ants, hoppers, caddis and tiny suedos. No need to nymph fish at this point, it's good as well. The browns are big and the rainbows are fat. Time to get your fall fishing on.
