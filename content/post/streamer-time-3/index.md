For me spring is the best time to throw streamers! I like to streamer fish when the water temps are in the mid forties. The big browns get active, and like to eat the big stuff. On the sunny days with calm conditions you can see the fish come and attack. I tie a lot of my streamers with small amounts of weight, this allows the fly to entice fish up from the bottom. People who only fish streamers deep are missing a really cool opportunity to see the fish attack. The visual game of streamer throwing is just as cool as a dry fly eat in my opinion. Let the games begin!
