After a hot summer with low water conditions we have made the transition into cooler weather. Along with the cooler air and shorter days the water temps are going down. Trout get real active during these times! The fall brings on a way better fish bite than the dog days of summer. The fish start to eat more often and for longer periods of the day. The fish also start to fight harder when hooked. The water temps will come back through that mid fifty degree zone, fish fight the hardest around 55 to 58.

Lots of reasons to fish the fall besides the above mentioned. The colors changed and the weather becomes nice. On the Missouri River we still deal with the aquatic vegetation, floating weeds as most people call it. Some people have a hard time dealing with the weeds, for these folks I recommend fishing April through mid July. One of things that enjoy about fall fishing is, the big brown trout often come out of hiding and start to eat more in the daylight hours. The brownies go missing for awhile in early August, They reappear in late August, I'm always ready. We hope to see you soon.
