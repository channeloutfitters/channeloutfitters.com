Another season has come to an end. It was a good season all in all. I personally guided 2 of the biggest mule deer I have ever had the pleasure of seeing! Still the end of the season is bittersweet! As the outfitter, you hope all of your clients have the perfect hunt. This is usually not the case. Many factors determine success, most of which we can't control. It still doesn't feel good when good clients have a less than stellar hunt!

All we can do now is look forward to the next season. We will hope for a mild winter and a wet spring. We will start posting some hunt stories from this season, some amazing hunts took place!
