One of the best ways to learn more about fishing Montana's Missouri River is to hire a guide your first time or two. The mighty Mo can be a real challenge to fly fishers who have never fished here before. We as guides see it all the time, first time Missouri anglers with all the right flies but no fish in the net. Usually new anglers have the right flies, weight and depth as prescribed at the fly shop. The common factor is poor rowing ability and lack of knowledge on where to look for trout. The Missouri is big and flat to the average eye. One must look close at the surface to understand the subtle shelves and drop offs below.

I see many first timers only catch a fish or two on a multi day fishing trip. Maybe they are too proud to goÂ guided or simply can't afford it. Either way a guide can help you get started on the mighty Mo! When we have our famous hatches, finding those trout can be a lot easier! Wade fisherman can actually do well if the flows are within reason for wade fishing. Good luck and happy fishing!
