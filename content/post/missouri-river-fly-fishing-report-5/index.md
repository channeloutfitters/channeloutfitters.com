Its been real good here on the Mighty Mo. The river came up from recent rain events but still is fishing well. The fish are real healthy and fighting hard with the current water temperatures. We are in the beginning of our best and most prolific hatches of the season! The trout are feeding on massive amounts of may flies and caddis.

As the water drops the next few days we will catch some of our biggest fish of the season on dries. If you are not in Montana now you should be! You should make plans now for next June.
