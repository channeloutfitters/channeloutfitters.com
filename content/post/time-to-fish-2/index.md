We have missed some guiding action do to Da Rona. We are ready to get out and start guiding and asserting our dominance in the Big Brown Trout world! I'm fishing with a friend and fellow guide this weekend. One thing for sure we will have fun. We will likely hook some big browns on dry's and streamers. You jealous?

We hope to see you in May and if not June for sure. Stay tuned my friends!
