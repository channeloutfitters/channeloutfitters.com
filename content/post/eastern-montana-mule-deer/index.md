It has been another mild winter for Eastern Montana. Mild winters are good and bad! Good, because the deer live another season. Bad, because we are headed into another drought. The deer are very resilient, even in a drought we still kill some nice deer! With any luck at all, we will get some moisture out in the big dry.
