Well, the spring special was a smash! It was a brown trout marathon for sure. Looking forward, the month of May is fishing good. I hate to make predictions about the river conditions but, unless we get a major amount of rain we will be out of water. May might be the best month on the Mighty Mo this year. We currently have midges, BWO's, Caddis and March Browns hatching daily. The nymph game is strong as the fish move out of their winter waters into the more speedy runs. Water temperatures become a positive factor in the month of May. More hatches and better streamer bites happen with the perfect water temps. Fly-Fishing on Montana's Missouri River is as good as it gets! I suggest that you consider a trip to the Missouri next May. A good time to fish Montana's best river!
