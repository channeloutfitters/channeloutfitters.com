We are coming into the dog days of summer over here on the Missouri River. We get some hot temperatures this time of year. The fishing has been really good despite the heat. We have been having massive trico hatches along with caddis. The dry fly fishing is really strong for the first 4 hours of the day. The afternoon is too hot to fish and by that time the fish are done as well. We recommend early starts and early off. I have been rolling with caddis dries and hoppers later in the day. Guys who like to target the pods have been doing well with trico and rusty spinners.
