After Melody shot her big whitetail, it was time for hubby to get his. Mark was looking for a mule deer and we were confident. We headed west that morning with the rising sun in our favor. Driving the creek bottom, it didn't take long to tell that all the deer were up on the tops. We spotted several bucks in the first 15 minutes. As we winded down the road, we spotted two bucks sky-lined, they had a doe. A quick look through my spotting scope and I could see really nice front forks! I say it's a shooter!

The deer were high on their perch and able to see our approach. I drove back a half mile and out of sight. We now were able to cross a long flat to the base of the hill. Looked easy, but not so much. We had to cross some 3 to 4 foot snow drifts that had crusted over. You could walk a few steps then fall through up to your waste. I'm glad these two are in such good shape! We hade almost to the base of the hill but had a major creek crossing. I chose a narrow but deep area in hopes of solid ice. I went first hoping the ice was safe, we are good.

Now up a steep hill then side hill until we find the deer again. At this point, I'm thinking this is taking way to long. After a long climb through snow drifts we were near the top. I peeked over to find my land-marks and get my bearings. We were still a ways away from where we last seen the deer. Now we needed to side hill to stay out of sight. It was steep and icy and fool of drifts. Slow going and we were getting all over heated. Clients in poor shape would have been mad at me long ago! Mark and Melody just had smiles, they crave the adventure. My mind was starting to doubt if the deer were still around, or if we could get close enough on the wide open plains.

We made to my land-mark and I needed to peek over the top. It all looked different than my mind had imagined from the truck a hour ago. Some deer to our right that we had skirted around, we still need to go further west. To cross a big canyon we had to go down to nearly the bottom, then back up the steep slope. Now when I looked over I expected to see our deer. Sure enough, the smaller buck was bedded and looking our direction. We where staying way low! The does was there and then finally I spotted a horn barley visible through the short grass. The big one was laying lower than the others, actually closer. We needed to make another move to get a better view without spooking the others. My heart rate was up, I had my doubts, to open, to many other deer around.

We made the final move. side-hill then look over. I have a knack for getting in position in really open country. As I looked over, I was surprised at how close we are. I whispered to mark that he was the the buck on the right and to shoot as soon as he could get situated. The deer are now up looking our way. I hissed, shoot. Mark got it all together and dropped the buck with one well placed shot. What a fun and challenging hunt!
