April is a fun time to fish in Montana! You never know what you will get as far as weather or hatches. It sure is fun when it all comes together! We sure had a good trip with old friend Mike Lavoy from Havre, MT. We had one of those days where we got them with streamers, nymphs and dry's. Mike had one of those days he won't soon forget! The picture will help him remember his stellar day.
