Smooth sailing on the Mighty Mo this month. Not many anglers around. Still the mass amounts of moronic inner-tubers! Yes I said it, if you float the Missouri without fly fishing your a dumbass! Go to a lake to be loud and sink your beer cans! Anyhow, the fishing is good, the fish are in great shape. As the water temps hit the highest of the summer you should fight the fish quick and make sure they are upright as you release.
