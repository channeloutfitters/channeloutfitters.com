Not the best fishing of the year but it can be rewarding. For those who are patient and willing to throw the hoppers, big time trout bite. The August cool down usually takes place around the 3rd week of August. At that time the trout can really fire up a bit. After the long hot dog days of summer the cool down is a welcome event. We will just keep plugging way catching the rare big brown until the fishing picks up.
