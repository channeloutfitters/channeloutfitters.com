Some of you may have read the story of Mike's incredible buck in the latest issue of Eastman's Hunting Journal. Congratulations to the hunter Mike LaVoy on great Buck!

Just a few thoughts on this truly giant mule deer buck. The Hunter and guide have been humbled by our good fortune. Even though Mike's buck made the cover story of Eastman's and we possibly harvested the biggest buck taken in Montana in 2016, we are still just a couple of average guys who love the outdoors!

Sometime dreams do come true! We will never forget the morning that all the planets aligned and we were able to harvest this tremendous Mule Deer! Good shooting Mike!
