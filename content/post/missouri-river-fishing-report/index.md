You missed the real good stuff, like fish rising all day to caddisÂ and PMDs. That being said, fishing is still OK. Catching some big ones with the right kind of anglers. What are the right kind of anglers you ask? Guys who are patient and willing to throw the hopper all day regardless of how many bites, a rare breed indeed. For all others we have bobbers! plenty of action on the bobbers! Bring your sun screen and lets fish.
