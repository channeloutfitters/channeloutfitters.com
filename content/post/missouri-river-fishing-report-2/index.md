The fishing has been pretty good! Not the best dry fly bite but some trico eaters can be found daily. The hopper bite can be day to day.Â Hoppers can be stellar in the clouds.

The nymph fishing is good to great depending on who you talk to. I've been looking for big ones, not numbers. As you can see, the big ones have been coming to my net. Big bugs in shallow water have been my game. Guys have been throwing shallow or in the deep trenches. The cool down is coming!
