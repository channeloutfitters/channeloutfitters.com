Â 



My friend and fellow mule deer hunter Mike L. came out to hunt again last season. Mike killed the biggest mule deer in the state a few years back. This time we just wanted to have some fun and see what we could find. I knew of some good mulies from bow season but we couldn't find them, big country out there. I did tell Mike that the whitetail deer had been doing well the last few years and might see a good one that could make us forget about the mule deer. As we were just about done for the day we spotted a big old whitetail laying on the edge of a field. Mike said I'll shoot that! I agreed as I was counting six points on each side and the buck looked old. After a quick sneak we where in position. Mike's trusty 270 put the old deer to sleep.
