The Fish are rising to mayflies and caddis in the blazing sun. Yes the fish on the Missouri river do not mind looking upÂ into the sun as long as the bugs are present. The next 3 weeks will be the best of the dry-fly fishing! After that it will slow down to a crawl. If you like to throw dry's all day long you might want to make plans for next June.
