Wï»¿ell, the 2022 season is in the books as they say. It was a fantastic fishing season and a hideous hunting season. The Missouri River was at its very best for big fish and lots of them! Fly-fishing rivers are like hunting areas in a lot of ways. Droughts and hi water years dictate the growth and numbers. The hunting in large parts of Eastern Montana did not have the desired weather to produce growth or numbers. Two years of severe drought have things out of whack. We did have some good elk hunting in our Musselshell camp along with some good whitetail deer. With the new year coming we always have hope for better conditions for the deer.
