June is prime time to fish the Missouri River! We have our biggest hatches this time of year and the big ones come up to eat. The best part of June is the water temperatures are the best they get until fall. The prime water temps make the bugs hatch and make the fish rise. You get the idea! Caddis may-flies and brown drakes. Get here now!
