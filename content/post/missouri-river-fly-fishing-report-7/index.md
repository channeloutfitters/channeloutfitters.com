May is a great month to fly fish the Missouri River. The water temps are starting to warm a bit and the fish are really responding. Hatches are the Mother's Day caddis and March Browns. The dry fly fishing has been hit or miss mostly miss. If the the clouds are overhead and the wind stays down some nice fish are up. Streamer fishing has been good to us! Those who stick with it can get the big reward. Nymph fishing is insane! The bite has been all day every day for quite some time. If you wanna catch big browns, you should have been here yesterday.
