Well it's been a long hot summer. The Missouri River needs to cool down a bit. Looks like that's what going to happen weather wise. As we get the water cooler the next hatch comes and some caddis come back. Then we see the fish start to put on the fall feed bag! Fish get more desperate to gain some weight before winter. Good things coming, we hope to see you on the Mighty Mo.
