May is a great time to fish Montana's Missouri River. We are on the verge of a large caddis hatch along with a some sizable drakes. The water volume is at the upper limits for the fish to rise well but I've seen some big fish rise in the past with similar conditions.

As of now nymph fishing is really good some days and really tough other days. Most guides are getting it done day to day. Most do it yourself guys are having some really tough days, especially in the sun. I have not heard many great reports about streamers but as the water warms fishing certain banks can be good.
