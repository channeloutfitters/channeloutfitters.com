As you can see August does not suck, at least from this anglers standpoint. The dog days of summer are not the ideal fishing scenario but big browns like to eat it for the patient anglers. I always have guided some of the my biggest fish in August. Warm weather and warm water doesn't seem to bother big browns. It might make them more hungry! The warm water makes them easier to land. While you are in you air-conditioned homes I will be here catching pigs!
