We had some good luck drawing some Montana hunting tags this year. I should say our clients did. We will be taking 3 bowhunters for elk in our new hunting area. We will also be guiding a couple of lucky rifle hunters for elk in a very special area. It's always exciting to find out the draw results, this year was really good to us outfitters here in Montana. With the new Outfitter Sponsored Preference system all of our clients received the general deer/elk combo. Some of our clients got lucky in the special elk draw. We are looking forward to the season.
