The license deadline is fast approaching. In Montana, you have until April 1 to apply for your hunting tags. We are currently selling some elk bow hunts. Some favorable laws are now in place to help our clients get tags. In the quality hunting district that we have a lodge in, the quota of 1800 archery tags are set. I think the odds of getting these tags are pretty high. If you have ever considered a trophy elk hunt, the time is now! Through the outfitter sponsored preference point you are guaranteed the deer/elk combo. After that we will help you apply for the archery permit in our unit. The big bulls live here! You should give it a try.
