We where hopeful going into this season that the Trophy Mule Deer grew some good horns. We started out with some really good Montana Bucks but slowly started to realize that the drought conditions have impacted the horn growth and more importantly the physical condition of the animals. Our area has many crops, even though the crops failed they have much needed food for the deer. Perhaps the bigger issue might be lack of water. I think that deer have traveled to more remote areas for water or any green food source, both are in short supply!

Not everything is doom and gloom! We have a big population of young bucks coming on and a overpopulation of doe. Hopefully we will receive much needed moisture in the upcoming months. I have heard about drought conditions and poor hunting and or horn growth across the west across. Fingers crossed that the magnificent mule deer make it through!

I will leave you with a picture of Marc's stunning buck that we got on the first week of season. A great Montana Buck!
