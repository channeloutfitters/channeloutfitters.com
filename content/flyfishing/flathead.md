A glacial river consisting of three branches, the North, South, and Middle Forks, combining to form the Main Flathead River. Although the system is not as famous as other Western Montana Rivers, it provides good dry fly opportunities for beginner anglers. A very scenic river with Westslope Cutthroat fishing close to Glacier National Park.
