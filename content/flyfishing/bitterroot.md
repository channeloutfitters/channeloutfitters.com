![Bitterroot River](images/bitterroot-river.png)

Free-stone river with many side channels full of rainbows, cutthroats, and brown trout. It flows through the Bitterroot Valley, with mountain views to the east and west. There is no shortage of any big fish. The Bitterroot is a very productive river with many hatches. It fishes well in the spring with Green Drakes and Skwalla Stoneflies.
