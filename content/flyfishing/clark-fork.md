Provides the avid fly fisher with excellent opportunities for big rainbow cutthroat. The slow and meandering flows fool many. But these fish are super strong and fight hard in this "big" water. The Clark Fork offers productive surface and sub-surface fishing. Great dry fly action throughout the summer, including caddis, various mayflies, and stoneflies.
